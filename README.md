## Synopsis
This application was initially supposed to be a fitness app which can provide a user with his or her activities, sport clubs and general data using Strava API. As it was revealed during building, not all features could be implemented and, so this app is semi-finished (poorly mobile-optimized f.e.). I'm personally not happy with this app, so decided to to spent time on complete finishing of it.

## Motivation
A try to implement already created by community React components (such as router animations or loaders) and using CSS-grid
